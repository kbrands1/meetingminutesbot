Meeting: Weekly Team Standup
Date: 2026-02-03
Participants: Khalid, Ahmed, Sara, Fahad

Khalid: Good morning everyone. Let's start with updates.

Ahmed: I finished the API documentation yesterday. The frontend team needs to review it by Friday.

Sara: I'll handle the review. Also, Fahad, can you update the database schema? We need the new user fields added before next week.

Fahad: Sure, I'll get that done by Wednesday.

Khalid: Great. Sara, please also prepare the quarterly report. It's due by end of month.

Sara: Will do. One more thing - we need someone to look into the performance issues on the dashboard. It's been slow since the last deploy.

Khalid: Ahmed, can you investigate that? Make it a priority.

Ahmed: I'll start on it today. Should have findings by tomorrow.

Khalid: Perfect. Let's also schedule a design review for the new feature. Fahad, can you set that up for next Tuesday?

Fahad: Done. I'll send the invite after this meeting.

Khalid: Thanks everyone. Let's reconvene next Monday.
